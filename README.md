Foodify Website
Overview
Foodify is a web application created using React to help users explore, save, and view recipes. The app features a dynamic homepage with a carousel of trending recipes, a search bar to find specific recipes, a favourites page to manage saved recipes, and detailed recipe pages. The app uses React Router for navigation, Redux for state management (specifically for favourites), and Axios to fetch recipe data from a local recipes.json file. The live website is hosted on Netlify and can be accessed at https://foodify-website.netlify.app.

Features
Homepage Carousel: Displays trending recipes, showing 3 recipes at a time in fullscreen and 1 at a time on small screens. Users can navigate left and right using arrow buttons.
Favourites: Add or remove recipes to/from your favourites by tapping the heart icon on the homepage or favourites page.
Search Bar: Located in the header, it checks if a recipe is available. If found, clicking the result takes you to the recipe details page; if not, it displays a "recipe not available" message.
Recipe Details: View recipe details including name, picture, ingredients, and steps by clicking "View Recipe" from the homepage, favourites, or search results.
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes, with the navbar icons simplifying to just icons (no text) on smaller screens.
Persistent Favourites: Favourites are stored in localStorage via Redux, so they persist across page reloads.
Recipe Data: All recipe data is stored in recipes.json and fetched using Axios or the Fetch API.
Getting Started
Initial State
When you first open the website, it will appear empty, showing only the navbar at the top. To view the homepage with the recipe carousel:

Navigate to the homepage by clicking the Homepage icon (a house icon) in the navbar.
Using the Favourites Feature
The favourites list starts empty.
To add a recipe to your favourites, click the heart icon on a recipe card (on the homepage or favourites page). The heart will fill in to indicate itâ€™s been added.
To remove a recipe, click the heart icon again, and it will revert to an outline, removing the recipe from your favourites.
View your saved recipes by clicking the Favourites icon (a filled heart) in the navbar.
How It Works
Homepage:
The Homepage.js component fetches recipes from recipes.json and displays 3 trending recipes at a time (1 on small screens).
Users can slide left/right using arrows and add/remove favourites by tapping the heart icon (toggles between FavoriteBorderIcon and FavoriteIcon).
The "View Recipe" button links to /recipe/:id.
Search:
In Header.js, the search bar filters recipes.json as you type.
If a recipe matches, it shows a clickable link to /recipe/:id; if not, it displays "[search term] recipe not available."
Favourites:
The Favourites.js component lists all saved recipes from Redux state.
Users can view details (/recipe/:id) or remove items by tapping the heart icon.
Recipe Details:
RecipeCard.js fetches the specific recipe from recipes.json using the :id from the URL and displays its details.
Tech Stack
React: Core framework for building the UI.
React Router: Handles routing between pages (homepage, favourites, recipe details).
Redux: Manages the favourites list state with Redux Toolkit.
Axios: Installed and used to create an API-like fetch from recipes.json (though some components use fetch directly).
Material-UI Icons: Used for visual elements like the heart, home, and search icons.
CSS: Custom styles for each component, with separate .css files for key components.
File Structure and Routes
Routes
The app uses React Router to connect different pages via the following routes:

/ or /homepage: Homepage (Homepage.js), displaying the carousel of trending recipes.
/favourites: Favourites page (Favourites.js), showing all saved recipes.
/recipe/:id: Recipe details page (RecipeCard.js), displaying a specific recipe based on its ID.
JavaScript Files and Their CSS
Header.js (Header.css):
Purpose: Displays the navigation bar with a logo (Foodify), search bar, and links to homepage and favourites.
Features: The search bar checks recipes.json for matches, showing availability and linking to recipe details if found.
Homepage.js (Carousel.css, Homepage.css):
Purpose: Serves as the homepage, featuring a carousel of trending recipes.
Features: Shows 3 recipes at a time (1 on small screens), with left/right arrows for navigation. Includes "View Recipe" and heart icon buttons to view details or toggle favourites.
Favourites.js (Favourite.css):
Purpose: Displays a list of favourite recipes in a grid layout.
Features: Allows viewing recipe details or removing recipes from favourites using the heart icon.
Recipe.js:
Purpose: Lists all recipes from recipes.json (not directly routed but used for testing or as a base).
Features: Displays recipe title, image, ingredients, and steps in a simple list format.
RecipeCard.js (RecipeCard.css):
Purpose: Shows detailed information for a single recipe based on the :id URL parameter.
Features: Includes the recipe name, picture, ingredients (unordered list), and steps (ordered list).
favouritesSlice.js:
Purpose: Redux slice managing the favourites list.
Features: Handles adding, removing, and clearing favourites, syncing with localStorage.
store.js:
Purpose: Configures the Redux store.
Features: Integrates the favouritesSlice reducer for state management.
Data
recipes.json:
Purpose: Stores all recipe data (e.g., id, title, image, ingredients, steps) in a JSON format.
Usage: Fetched by components like Header.js, Homepage.js, and RecipeCard.js using Axios or Fetch API.

Additional Notes
CSS Files: Each major component (Header.js, Homepage.js, Favourites.js, RecipeCard.js) has a corresponding .css file for custom styling.
Axios: Installed and used in Recipe.js to fetch data, though other components use the native fetch API.
Responsive Design: The carousel and navbar adapt to screen size, with simplified icons on smaller screens.
Future Improvements
Autoload Homepage: Currently, the homepage does not load automatically when opening the website via the Netlify link (https://foodify-website.netlify.app). You must click the Homepage icon in the navbar to view it. In the future, the app could be updated to load the homepage automatically on launch. This works fine when running locally through VS Code (npm start), but the Netlify deployment needs adjustment (e.g., updating the default route in App.js or Netlify settings).
Firebase Integration and Login Page: To enhance user experience, the app could store recipe data in Firebase instead of a local recipes.json file. Additionally, adding a login page would allow users to have separate accounts, with their own favourites and preferences saved in Firebase, accessible upon login.
Improved Responsiveness: While the app has basic responsive design (e.g., navbar icons simplify on small screens), there are issues on certain devices (e.g., content overflow, inability to scroll recipe steps). Future updates could focus on improving responsiveness across all screen sizes, ensuring content is fully accessible and layouts adapt seamlessly.
